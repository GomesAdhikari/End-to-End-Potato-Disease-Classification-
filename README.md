A web-based application that uses deep learning to classify diseases in potato plants from leaf images. The application can identify various potato diseases using a trained CNN model, providing farmers and agricultural experts with a quick and efficient way to diagnose plant health issues.

## Features

- 🚀 Real-time disease classification
- 📸 Support for both JPG and PNG image formats
- 🎯 High accuracy disease prediction
- 💻 User-friendly web interface
- 🔄 Automatic image format conversion
- 🛡️ Secure file handling
- 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GomesAdhikari/End-to-End-Potato-Disease-Classification-
cd potato-disease-classification
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

```txt
Flask==2.0.1
tensorflow==2.x
Pillow==8.3.1
Werkzeug==2.0.1
numpy==1.19.5
etc.
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. Upload an image of a potato plant leaf through the web interface.

4. The application will process the image and display the predicted disease classification.

## Model Information

The application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of potato plant leaves. The model can classify the following conditions:
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Healthy

## Features in Detail

### Image Processing
- Automatic conversion of PNG images to JPG format
- Handles transparent backgrounds in PNG images
- Resizes images to 128x128 pixels for model input
- Maintains image quality during processing

### Security Features
- Secure filename handling
- Temporary file cleanup
- Error handling and validation
- Input sanitization

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Serves the main page
- `POST /predict`: Accepts image uploads and returns predictions
